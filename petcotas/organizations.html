                <h2>Rescue Me</h2>
                <p>Most adoption sites help you find cats and dogs. Some will help you find reptiles and farm animals. Rescue Me goes even further and not only has countless pets up for adoption, but also has resources available for wildlife rehabilitators. Given the variety of animals available, Rescue Me requires future pet parents to narrow down their choice beforehand. Once you've decided on the type of pet you want to adopt, you can narrow your search down by state.</p>
